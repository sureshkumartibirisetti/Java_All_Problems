1869. Longer Contiguous Segments of Ones than Zeros
Example 1:
Input: s = "1101"
Output: true
Explanation:
The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: "1101"
The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 1: "1101"
The segment of 1s is longer, so return true.
Example 2:
Input: s = "111000"
Output: false
Explanation:
The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 3: "111000"
The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "111000"
The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.
Example 3:
Input: s = "110100010"
Output: false
Explanation:
The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: "110100010"
The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "110100010"
