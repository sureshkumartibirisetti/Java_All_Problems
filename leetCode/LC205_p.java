//205. Isomorphic Strings
//Example 1:
//Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
//Output: true
//Explanation:
//The strings s and t can be made identical by:
//Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
//Mapping 'g' to 'd'.
//Example 2:
//Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
//Output: false
//Explanation:
//The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'.
//Example 3:
//Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
//Output: true
