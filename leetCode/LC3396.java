3396. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Elements in Array Distinct
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,2,3,3,5,7]
Output: 2
Explanation:
In the first operation, the first 3 elements are removed, resulting in the array [4, 2, 3, 3, 5, 7].
In the second operation, the next 3 elements are removed, resulting in the array [3, 5, 7], which has distinct elements.
Therefore, the answer is 2.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [4,5,6,4,4]
Output: 2
Explanation:
In the first operation, the first 3 elements are removed, resulting in the array [4, 4].
In the second operation, all remaining elements are removed, resulting in an empty array.
Therefore, the answer is 2.
Example 3:
Input: nums = [6,7,8,9]
Output: 0
Explanation:
The array already contains distinct elements. Therefore, the answer is 0.
